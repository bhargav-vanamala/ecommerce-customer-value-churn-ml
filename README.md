# E-Commerce Customer Value & Churn Prediction (ML)

This project analyzes real-world e-commerce transaction data to identify high-value customers and predict churn risk using machine learning.

It combines **customer lifetime value (CLV)** analysis with **churn prediction**, enabling data-driven retention strategies.

This project is designed as a **flagship portfolio project** for Data Analyst, Business Intelligence, and Machine Learning roles.
